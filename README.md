# Decision-Tree-Classifier
This is a mini-project in which we use Decision Tree Algorithm to solve classification problem in the famous Iris Dataset.

Decision Tree Algorithm is a type of supervised learning in which classification models are in the form of tree structure. 
In the algorithm, the dataset is divided further into subsets based on a particular condition.

This Decision Tree Classifier is implemented using Python including it's libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn and Matplotlib.
